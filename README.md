# Manual for controlling LEDs with a node based on the WorldTimeAPI

## Introduction
In this manual, I will guide you through the process of turning the LEDs on a LED strip on or off based on your own specified time, using the WorldTimeAPI as the reference for the current time.

## Requirements
- NodeMCU
- LEDstrip
- USB/USB-C to Micro USB
- Arduino IDE
- Wi-Fi

## Step 1: Installing libraries
The first thing we want to do, is download all libraries we will use over the course of this manual.
Lets start by opening Arduino IDE an navigate to the libraries tab on the left hand side of the screen.
